	<p class="textstudy">                     While traveling, Hyapatia took time to study on various reservations with wise elders. These medicine men and women have since passed and it has become obvious that sharing this information is imperative to its preservation. This is what prompted Hyapatia to write her books and produce her television show known as Native Strength.
